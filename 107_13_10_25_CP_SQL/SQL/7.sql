/*
Write a SQL query to display the names of all directors whose movies have 
an average rating higher than the overall average rating of all movies.

Hint: Use a nested subquery in the HAVING clause to compare the directorâ€™s 
average rating with the global average.

================================================================================
Artists (id, name, email, phone_number)
Movies (id, name, release_year, budget)
Directions (id, Artist_id, Movie_id)
Reviews (id, date_of_review, Artist_id, Movie_id, rating)
