  "The Solar System\nIntroduction\nThe Solar System is a vast and fascinating system of celestial objects bound together by gravity.\nAt its center lies the Sun, a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma that provides the necessary heat\nand light to sustain life on Earth. The Solar System comprises eight planets, their moons, dwarf\nplanets, asteroids, comets, and other space objects.\n1. The Sun\nThe Sun is a star located at the center of our Solar System.

  "The Sun is a star located at the center of our Solar System. It accounts for more than 99.8% of the\ntotal mass. Composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, it undergoes nuclear fusion, producing\nenergy\nthat radiates throughout the Solar System.\n2. The Planets\nThere are eight planets, divided into two categories:\n- Terrestrial Planets:\n- Mercury: The closest planet to the Sun; it has a rocky surface and no atmosphere.\n- Venus: Similar in size to Earth but with a thick, toxic atmosphere of carbon dioxide.",
  "- Venus: Similar in size to Earth but with a thick, toxic atmosphere of carbon dioxide.\n- Earth: The only planet known to support life, with water and a breathable atmosphere.\n- Mars: Known as the Red Planet, it has the tallest volcano and a thin atmosphere.\n- Gas Giants and Ice Giants:\n- Jupiter: The largest planet, famous for its Great Red Spot and dozens of moons.\n- Saturn: Known for its prominent ring system.\n- Uranus: An ice giant with a tilted axis and faint rings.",
  "- Uranus: An ice giant with a tilted axis and faint rings.\n- Neptune: The farthest planet, known for its deep blue color and strong winds.\n3. Dwarf Planets\nDwarf planets like Pluto, Eris, Haumea, and Makemake are celestial bodies that orbit the Sun and\nare spherical in shape but have not cleared their orbital path of other debris.\n4. Moons\nMany planets have natural satellites or moons. Earth has one, Mars has two, and Jupiter and Saturn",
  "Many planets have natural satellites or moons. Earth has one, Mars has two, and Jupiter and Saturn\nhave dozens. Ganymede (Jupiter's moon) is the largest in the Solar System.\n5. Asteroids and the Asteroid Belt\nAsteroids are rocky bodies found mostly in the Asteroid Belt between Mars and Jupiter. They vary in\nsize and shape and are remnants from the early Solar System.\n6. Comets\nComets are icy bodies that release gas or dust. When near the Sun, they develop a glowing head\nand",
  "Comets are icy bodies that release gas or dust. When near the Sun, they develop a glowing head\nand\ntail due to the effects of solar radiation.\n7. The Kuiper Belt and Oort Cloud\nThe Kuiper Belt is a region beyond Neptune filled with icy objects and dwarf planets. The Oort Cloud\nis a hypothetical distant area where long-period comets are thought to originate.\nConclusion\nThe Solar System is a dynamic and evolving system.
